# Module 1: Data Structures & Algorithms

**Duration:** 12 hours  
**Focus:** Algorithm analysis and fundamental data structures

## 📋 Module Overview

This module covers essential data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of technical interviews and software development. You'll learn complexity analysis, array/string manipulation, linked list operations, and stack/queue implementations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
