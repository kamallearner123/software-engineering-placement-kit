# Module 2: C/C++/Python Efficient Coding

**Duration:** 8 hours  
**Focus:** Programming fundamentals and efficient coding practices

## 📋 Module Overview

This module strengthens your programming foundations in C, C++, and Python. You'll learn to write clean, efficient code that is commonly expected in technical interviews, focusing on pseudocode, language essentials, and best coding practices.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Write clear and effective pseudocode
- Master C/C++ essentials including pointers and memory management
- Use Python efficiently for interview problems
- Apply clean code principles and error handling
- Develop robust test cases for your solutions

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Pseudocode (2 hours)
- Writing clear algorithmic descriptions
- Using loops effectively
- Conditional operators and logic
- Function definitions
- Common patterns for interview questions

### 2. C/C++ Essentials (2 hours)
- Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Pointers and References
- Memory Management (malloc/free, new/delete)
- Arrays and Strings in C/C++
- Structures and Unions
- Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### 3. Python for Efficiency (2 hours)
- Python Basics Review
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
- List Comprehensions
- String Operations
- Built-in Functions for Interviews
- Common Python Patterns
- Time-saving Python Features

### 4. Coding Practices (2 hours)
- Clean Code Principles:
  - Meaningful variable and function naming
  - Small, focused functions
  - Code readability
- Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Writing Test Cases
- Debugging Techniques
- Code Optimization

## 🔨 Sample Programs

The `Sample_Programs/` directory contains working examples in C, C++, and Python demonstrating:
- Common algorithms implementation
- Best coding practices
- Error handling patterns
- Efficient solutions

## 📖 Recommended Approach

1. Practice writing pseudocode before coding
2. Implement the same problem in multiple languages
3. Focus on clean, readable code
4. Always handle edge cases
5. Test your code thoroughly

## 🌟 Key Interview Topics

- Pointer manipulation in C/C++
- Memory management concepts
- Python data structure operations
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Test-driven problem solving

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Pseudocode First:** Always sketch your algorithm before coding
- **Language Choice:** Pick Python for quick implementation, C/C++ for performance-critical code
- **Practice:** Write at least 3 programs daily
- **Code Review:** Review and refactor your own code
