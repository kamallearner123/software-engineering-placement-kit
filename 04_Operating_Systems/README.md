- Monitor system resources
- Set up file permissions correctly

## 📖 Recommended Approach

1. Practice Linux commands daily in a terminal
2. Write small automation scripts
3. Use debugging tools on real scenarios
4. Understand process and thread concepts thoroughly
5. Explore system logs regularly

## 🌟 Key Interview Topics

- Process vs Thread differences
- IPC mechanisms and use cases
- Common Linux commands and their usage
