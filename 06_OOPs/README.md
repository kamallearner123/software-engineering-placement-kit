# Module 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Focus:** OOP concepts and principles

## 📋 Module Overview

This module covers the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming. You'll learn about classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction - concepts that are essential for writing maintainable and scalable code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Define and use classes and objects
- Implement encapsulation with access modifiers
- Apply inheritance for code reuse
- Understand and use polymorphism
- Create UML class diagrams
- Write object-oriented solutions to real-world problems

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. OOP Basics (1 hour)
- **Classes and Objects**
  - Defining classes
  - Creating objects (instances)
  - Class members (attributes and methods)
- **Encapsulation**
  - Data hiding
  - Access Modifiers:
    - `public`
    - `private`
    - `protected`
  - Getters and Setters
- **Constructors and Destructors**
  - Default constructors
  - Parameterized constructors
  - Copy constructors
  - Destructors (C++)
- **UML Class Diagrams**
  - Representing classes
  - Relationships between classes
  - Notation and symbols

### 2. Inheritance & Polymorphism (1 hour)
- **Inheritance**
  - What is inheritance?
  - Base class (Parent) and Derived class (Child)
  - Types of Inheritance:
    - Single inheritance
    - Multiple inheritance
    - Multilevel inheritance
    - Hierarchical inheritance
  - `super` keyword / Base class constructors
- **Polymorphism**
  - **Compile-time Polymorphism**
    - Function overloading
    - Operator overloading
  - **Runtime Polymorphism**
    - Method overriding
    - Virtual functions (C++)
    - Abstract classes and interfaces
- **Abstraction**
  - Abstract classes
  - Interfaces
  - Hiding implementation details

## 🔨 Practical Examples

Real-world OOP scenarios in the `Examples/` directory:
- Banking system (Account, SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount)
- Vehicle hierarchy (Vehicle, Car, Bike)
- Shape classes (Shape, Circle, Rectangle)
- Employee management system

## 📖 Recommended Approach

1. Start with basic class and object creation
2. Practice encapsulation with real examples
3. Implement inheritance hierarchies
4. Understand polymorphism through overloading and overriding
5. Draw UML diagrams for your designs
6. Solve OOP design problems

## 🌟 Key Interview Topics

- Class vs Object difference
- What is encapsulation and why is it important?
- Explain inheritance with examples
- Difference between overloading and overriding
- What is polymorphism?
- Real-life examples of OOP concepts
- Abstract classes vs Interfaces
- Access modifiers and their use

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Think in Objects:** Model real-world entities as classes
- **Favor Composition over Inheritance:** When appropriate
- **Keep Classes Focused:** Single Responsibility Principle
- **Use Diagrams:** UML helps clarify design
- **Practice Design:** Solve design problems, not just coding

## 📝 Sample Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between a class and an object?
2. What is encapsulation?
3. What is inheritance?
4. What is method overloading?
5. What is abstraction?
6. Give real-life examples of inheritance and polymorphism.
7. What is the difference between public, private, and protected?
8. What are virtual functions? (C++)
9. What is an abstract class?
10. When would you use inheritance vs composition?

## 🛠️ OOP in Different Languages

- **C++:** Classes with pointers, virtual functions, multiple inheritance
- **Python:** Classes with `__init__`, inheritance, duck typing
- **Java:** Classes with interfaces, abstract classes, single inheritance
- **JavaScript:** Prototype-based OOP, ES6 classes

## 📚 Design Patterns (Bonus)

Once you master OOP basics, explore:
- Singleton pattern
- Factory pattern
- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern

## 📚 Additional Resources

- OOP examples in multiple languages
- UML diagram templates
- Design pattern references
